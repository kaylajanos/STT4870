Now, just to show how cool this is, we will mix in a little \texttt{R.}  First, consider the following graph where the \texttt{R} code that creates the graph is shown to the reader.

<<label = Rgraph, engine = 'R', fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, out.width=".75\\textwidth", fig.align='center'>>=
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake, fill = Type)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(Treatment ~ .) +
  theme_bw()

I love graphs!  The following graph created with \texttt{ggplot2} \citep{R-ggplot2} uses 
Greek letters in
the facet panels.  The \texttt{R} Code used to create the graph is not shown in the final document.  The code is hidden using the argument \texttt{echo = FALSE} in the \texttt{R} code chunk.   

<<label=ggplot2Graphs, engine = "R", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, echo = FALSE>>=
x <- seq(0, 7, length = 500)
y1 <- dweibull(x, 1, 1)
y2 <- dweibull(x, 1, 2)
y3 <- dweibull(x, 1, 3)
y4 <- dweibull(x, 2, 1)
y5 <- dweibull(x, 2, 2)
y6 <- dweibull(x, 2, 3)
y7 <- dweibull(x, 3, 1)
y8 <- dweibull(x, 3, 2)
y9 <- dweibull(x, 3, 3)
DF <- data.frame(fx = c(y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9))
DF$a[1:1500] = "alpha == 1"
DF$a[1501:3000] = "alpha == 2"
DF$a[3001:4500] = "alpha == 3"
DF$b[1:500] = "beta == 1"
DF$b[501:1000] = "beta == 2"
DF$b[1001:1500] = "beta == 3"
DF$b[1501:2000] = "beta == 1"
DF$b[2001:2500] = "beta == 2"
DF$b[2501:3000] = "beta == 3"

DF$b[3501:4000] = "beta == 2"
DF$b[4001:4500] = "beta == 3"
DF$x = x
#
previous_theme <- theme_set(theme_bw()) # set black and white theme
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = x, y = fx)) + geom_area(fill = "skyblue3") + 
  facet_grid(b~a, labeller = label_parsed) + 
  labs(x = "x", y = "f(x)",labeller = label_parsed) + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) 
theme_set(previous_theme) # Restore original theme

The graphs shown so far have fonts that do not match the font of the thesis.  To create graphs that have the same font as the thesis, use the \texttt{dev = "tikz"} option in the R code chunk.  \fref{graph2} uses the \texttt{dev = "tikz"} option so that the fonts in the graph are in agreement with the document fonts.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
<<G2, comment = NA, out.width=".65\\linewidth",fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, dev = "tikz",fig.height=5,fig.width=5>>=
set.seed(13)  # set seed
hist(rnorm(1000), col = "green", breaks = "Scott", freq = FALSE, main = "", xlab = "This font matches the document font!", ylab = "This font matches the document font!")
title(main = paste("Math with good fonts:","$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx = 1$"))
